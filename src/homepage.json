Prior to starting my Ph.D., I earned Master’s degrees in <a href='https://cse.umn.edu/datascience'>Data Science</a> and <a href='https://cla.umn.edu/linguistics'>Linguistics</a>, as well as a Bachelor's degree in <a href='https://cla.umn.edu/statistics'>Statistics</a> from the <a href='https://twin-cities.umn.edu/'>University of Minnesota</a>. During that time, I was advised by <a href='https://lanayarosh.com/'>Dr. Lana Yarosh</a> and <a href='https://dykang.github.io/'>Dr. Dongyeop Kang</a>.  I also earned a Master degree in <a href='https://cse.nd.edu'>Computer Science</a> at the <a href='https://www.nd.edu'>Univeristy of Notre Dame</a> where I studied in the <a href='https://hci.nd.edu'>ND-HCI lab</a>.",
    "bio": "My research lies at the intersection of <strong>Human Computer Interaction (HCI)</strong>, <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong>, and <strong>Social Computing</strong>. Language, as the medium of communication, serves as the social bridge among people. Standing at the crossroads of HCI, NLP and Social Computing, I am driven to explore the intricacies and nuances of communication dynamics in the evolving digital landscape. In my research journey, I am passionate about decoding how human-human or human-AI interactions unfold—how they communicate, collaborate, and sometimes conflict—and how these patterns can be harnessed to address pressing societal challenges."

The hashtags were strategically chosen from topics that would be uninteresting to the male audience they wanted to block. Through a mixed-methods approach, we analyzed the practice of hashtag re-appropriation based on 5,800 collected posts and interviewed 24 active users from diverse backgrounds to uncover users' motivations and reactions towards the re-appropriation.",
